### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Bachelor's in Computer Science, technology enthusiast. I love to learn new things, always looking for innovation and improvement. I have been working as software developer for almost five years, always being challenged to improve and grow.

Among the technologies that I have worked with, I would like to highlight the following:
 - Java (7, 8, 11, and 17)
 - Spring Framework (Spring Boot, Spring Data, Spring Security and Spring Cloud Stream)
 - Oracle SQL Developer as a relational database and MongoDB as a non-relational database
 - Maven and Gradle
 - JUnit and Mockito
 - Microservices (Feign, RestTemplate and message with RabbitMQ as a communication tool)
 - DevOps (basic knowledge in CI, CD, Jenkins and AWS, Docker and Kubernates)
 - GIT (version control tool for code)
 - Flyway (version control tool for database)

I have experience ranging from the implementation of new features to building applications from scratch.

This is a brief overview of my career.
